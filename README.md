# 02-Challenge-2

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to deploy a portfolio to showcase relevant skills to future employers. The project demonstrated the use of flexboxes, media queries, and CSS variables. The supporting HTML and CSS files reflected best practices for naming conventions, comments and other quality features. 

The acceptance criteria were as follows: 
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

All criteria were met and the site functions as expected. 

I learned that targeting parent attributes is the best way to manipulate content on the page. In one iteration of the code, flex attributes were applied to the children and it created inconsistencies in behavior. Applying attributes to higher order elements created more successful outcomes. I also learned that position is easier to affect using percentage values as inherited from parent attributes instead of forcing dramatic changes pixel by pixel. I now have a better handle on flex-box and front-end CSS features.
## Usage

The html and css file can be used to view the deployed page. A link to the mockup is accessible from the repository file list.
